# The main todo book

## Refactor the debug ui system
- Observer pattern? idk, it should have its own config with step speed and such
- should be able to be ctrl + S (Stop clock, ask for stuff)
- ctrl + S core dump with memory
- should allow custom commands like set_step_speed/sss <steps/sec>
- ability to "time travel" like, travel: 500 (500 clock cycles ahead)
